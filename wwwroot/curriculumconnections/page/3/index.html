				<div class="entry-content">

					<p><em>by Cathy Herrick</em></p>
<p>The idea of Mastery has been around for centuries, in many fields, and has many definitions.  In education writers, researchers, administrators, and teachers have their own pre-determined ideas as to what constitutes mastery.  A review of some of the most recent thinking on this topic reveals that there is no one common definition, nor a “right” definition, but rather some agreement as to what constitutes mastery and what does not constitute mastery relative to student learning and achievement.</p>
<p>Mastery, Mastery Learning, and a Mastery designation on a rubric all have different connotations.  Mastery is defined in the Oxford dictionary as, “an action demonstrating or involving great skill or power…. to perform a notable deed, or wonderful feat.”  Benjamin Bloom describes the concept of mastery learning as a possible outcome for any student who was provided adequate time and “favourable learning conditions” to perform and be assessed on a criterion-based scale determined by a teacher (Bloom,1977).  As a school division we are working to establish some common criteria to assess deeper levels of understanding of curricular outcomes, which we have labeled as Mastery on a rubric.</p>
<p>Teachers, administrators, coaches, consultants, and superintendents in our school division are exploring, collaborating, and doing some deep thinking about what Mastery as a concept means relative to student achievement.  Challenges to develop criteria, learning tasks, and exemplars are initiating some consternation and uncertainty for teachers when facing pressures from students and parents who are used to a point system to measure success.  However, this inquiry, discussion, experimentation, and reflection are all necessary components to understanding and developing the ways and means of ensuring that students have access to authentic learning activities that build the “fire in their bellies” to learn and to continue to learn.</p>
<p>Engaging students in learning has a fundamental tie to the Mastery level. Students demonstrating a desire to work hard, to think strategically, and to accept some ambiguity also clearly know themselves well as learners. Tomlinson worries about college students who have no experience of the “fire in their belly” to drive them to do hard thinking, to read, to debate ideas,  and to push themselves toward excellence in a real world pursuit” (Tomlinson, 2013 ). She worries that students don’t know how to reason or to think abstractly because they have learned to “jump through the hoops” of schooling, doing what is necessary to get the points.</p>
<p>At the Mastery level on a rubric we want to promote:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students accomplishing novel challenges through the application of skills and understandings</li>
<li>Students “effective transfer of learning done with creativity, polish, and grace” with an understanding of what has been done and why (Wiggins, 2013 p. 13)</li>
<li>A student’s desire to get better at something that matters to them</li>
<li>Authentic tasks at the heart of “doing” the subject</li>
</ul>
<p>We have taken a risk, developing rubrics that challenge students to demonstrate mastery of an outcome.  We are modeling the “messiness”, the risk-taking, the inquiry, the struggles, and the tenacity that we expect of our students at their highest levels.  We continue to learn; we have a “fire in our belly” to “get it right”, to assist our students in achieving the highest levels possible.</p>
<p>Though we can’t define or measure “mastery” only as an attitude/behaviour, nor can we completely ignore it as we observe students in their pursuit of Level 4 – Mastery.  Our Olympic athletes have provided us with some insight these past few weeks as they achieve mastery levels in their sport.  Not only have they learned the fundamental concepts and skills of their sport, but they have applied them and their understandings in races, in games, and during performances.  Every athlete has a fire in their belly to succeed. These athletes have not attained a level of Mastery focusing only on bits of knowledge, isolated drills, or by not knowing what excellence looks like.  Thus, on our rubrics we want to ensure that Mastery does <b>not</b> look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A march through facts and sub skills, dotted with quizzes</li>
<li>A high grade on a test/quiz of low level questions</li>
<li>A simple recall of facts and skills</li>
<li>Proficiency with drills and exams</li>
<li>Local norms and low expectations, nor</li>
<li>Arbitrary calculations</li>
</ul>
<p>Forging ahead as educators we must not be satisfied with learning that is just ‘good enough’. We chose this profession because we love to see the ‘light bulbs’ turn on, the excitement in the eyes of learners who make new discoveries, and we relish the moments when tough questions with no answers get asked and debated.  Developing classroom climates and practices that inspire kids to achieve mastery levels of learning involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students believing that the learning task matters,</li>
<li>Regular inquiry, problem solving, and innovation,</li>
<li>Timely and descriptive feedback (including re-assessments),</li>
<li>Fostering intrinsic motivation rather than pressure to get the grade,</li>
<li>Self-comparisons rather than comparisons to others,</li>
<li>Environments where students can safely take risks and believe that they can succeed, and</li>
<li>Planning that begins with the end in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gusky (2013) promotes that Mastery can only be measured in light of a world standard, that students deserve the opportunity to know where the bar is.  An Olympic athlete knows, or has an idea, of what Mastery looks like in his/her sport.   While, we in education may not be all the way there yet, the goal is worthy of the pursuit, which begins as a school division, extends to the province, the nation, and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>First Nations Education Act: Just another top down Act constructed without input from First Nations?</strong></p>
<p>People are all abuzz on twitter and facebook today, regarding the First Nations Education Act.  As I attempt to make sense of this piece of legislation, I am left to question, what is it? And what does it entail?  As we already know, First Nations students on–reserve,  receive funding through the federal government for their schools. Much of the infrastructure at the schools are in various states of decay, typically, there is little to no internet in most of the schools. I was surprised, when I came to Living Sky as I walked through various schools how abundant the schools were in resources. I saw ipads,  computer rooms, exercise rooms, equipment overflowing to the brim in the phys.ed equipment rooms and the science labs. This is something that I hadn’t often seen when visiting or working in First Nations Schools.  Of course, I don’t want to over generalize, as some communities had made huge efforts to stack classrooms with supplies and equipment, using funding from elsewhere, or fund raising.  However; schools on reserves are typically, being operated without having the budgets, which provincial schools do. This money is what attracts the specialized supports that larger provincial school divisions would have, such as education psychologists, occupational therapists, language, math and early learning consultants, arts education consultants or First Nation and Metis Achievement coordinators to name a few. In short, First Nations Schools are typically being run with bare bones funding.  We could come to the conclusion, like the federal government did, that First nations people are unable to handle their finances and that they are misspending monies which are meant for their education. However; when you see the funding formulas, you get a clearer picture of what it means to be a First Nations student in a First Nations school.</p>
<p>First of all, the funding formula, which is set out by the federal government, states that schools on reserves receive tuition as accorded by Ottawa. Whether the school is in a remote part of the province, or near a bustling city centre, the funding formula is the same. Schools typically receive between 3,000.00 – 7000.00 less per child in tuition fees, than if that same child were registered in a provincial school. Let’s say for instance that reserve school X has 300 student. After applying to INAC or DIAND as they’re called now, the school would typically receive, oh, let’s say, $7000.00 per student after nominal roll is collected on September 30. Therefore, the school would receive about  $2,100,000.00 for their operating budget,  to pay out teacher and staff contracts, maintenance fees, purchase equipment, and renovations as any other typical school would do. However; if those same students were enrolled in Provincial School Y, after nominal roll in September, that same school would receive up to 7000.00 more per student from the provincial government. Therefore, the funding formula could look like 300 students x 14,000.00 =4,200,000.00. As you can see, this is a significant difference in the operating costs and ability to hire quality teachers and to implement quality planning within the school.</p>
<p>When First Nations students switch from a reserve system, to a provincial system, there is a perception that they are usually delayed in reading, writing and math. We’re left to think that perhaps it has to do with the quality of the First Nation to administer their funding adequately, or perhaps the problem is the First Nations teachers, or the parents, or maybe it’s related to their culture. However; when we realize that indeed First Nations students are coming into school with a price over their heads which is sometimes half as much as a provincial student is worth, then we must wonder about why the reason for the funding disparity?</p>
<p>First Nations people are hopeful that the First Nations Education Act is going to address these funding disparities, so that First Nations children, living on-reserve,  can have a chance for a quality education, which is not only adequate and equal to provincial standards, but as well, that it will honour their culture, languages and heritage.  The First Nations Education Act was rolled out without consultation from First Nations people. In many cases, in order to receive their band’s operating budget, First Nations are being forced to adhere to the agreement before they receive their operating budgets.  First Nations people are wary that the government may have not addressed the funding disparity, but, is yet, forcing First Nations to comply with provincial curriculum standards with little to no financial supports to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>First Nations people are confused and concerned as to what the Act entails and why a First Nation Education Act is needed, especially without consultation from the people whom the act will encompass.  Some First Nation parents said, we already have negotiated for our education through treaties with the federal government and offloading the education responsibility to the province will, in effect, make treaty null and void. We’ll be hearing more about this as time goes by when on-reserve funding initiatives are either depleted or exhausted.  As educators of First Nations children, we should all be concerned about what this Act means for members of our society. As the achievement gap garners more and more attention, we’re forced to think critically about how and why funding disparities,  as such,  exist and whether forcing compliance to externally created top down initiatives are really going to make the changes they promise. More to come later.</p>

					<p>In my recent readings of Early Childhood blog posts I came across the following “poster” advocating for developmentally appropriate programming:</p>
<p><a href="../../files/2014/02/Blog-photo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2346" alt="Let Me Play" src="../../files/2014/02/Blog-photo-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/02/Blog-photo-200x300.jpg 200w, https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/02/Blog-photo.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve long been an advocate of deepening the understanding and support of play-based learning in early learning.</p>
<p>This leads me to wonder&#8230;</p>
<p>If our education system and society as a whole truly understood child development, what impact  would it have on our interactions with children and our programming decisions?</p>
<p>As educators if we truly supported the value and importance of play-based learning for our youngest learners, what changes would we make in our classroom environments and teaching practices?</p>
<p>As early childhood classroom teachers I believe we often, almost innately, understand the value of play and all the learning that is supported through play-based environments but we struggle with advocating for play-based activities and learning in our current education system.</p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to watch an exceptional group of high school journalism students in action at <a href="http://www.uchs.lskysd.ca/">Unity Composite High School</a> in Saskatchewan, Canada. With tremendous support from the divisions&#8217; ICS Assistant Manager, Ryan Kobelsky, students from UCHS and students from the <a href="http://www.uttamschool.org/pages/default.aspx">Uttam Girls’ School</a> near Delhi, Indian, broadcast a joint, simultaneous newscast that took place on Skype across a distance of 11,000 kilometers and 12 time zones.</p>
<p>Ruth Cey, classroom teacher and UCHS Assistant Administrator, had proposed to her  Journalism 20 class that they do an international broadcast  with a partner school.  She explored possibilities on <a href="https://education.skype.com/">Skype In The Classroom </a>and then, not satisfied that there was a suitable partner, she approached a student in her class, Kezia, asking her if she knew of a school in India that would be interested in a joint project.  She was aware that Kezia had connections and thought this might be a more effective way of finding a class with whom they could collaborate to create a series of television articles about daily life in India and Canada.</p>
<p>Kezia was soon on board  and became the go-between in India, teaching about the project in the classroom at the Uttam School for Girls, using the tools from the<a href="http://uchsinquiry.wikispaces.com/Journalism+20"> journalism wiki</a> and then conveying all sorts of information to the students and the school administration. During the month that Kezia was in India they stayed in touch via telephone and email. To quote Ms. Cey &#8220;she was brilliant – responsible and committed&#8221;. When Ruth was concerned that the project might not get done in a timely matter, Kezi assured her that it would. She was the lynch-pin in communicating and coordinating the Indian part of the project.</p>
<p>That evening the excitement in the studio was palpable as the class of 22 students, teachers, parents, guests, principal, and the press took their places to watch the live production.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2335" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="../../files/2014/01/IMG_1201.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2335" src="../../files/2014/01/IMG_1201-300x224.jpg" alt="Control Centre" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/01/IMG_1201-300x224.jpg 300w, https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/01/IMG_1201-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Control Centre</figcaption></figure>
<p>The control centre; tricaster, teleprompter, camera, lights, <i>Skype</i> laptop, and green screen were all ready to go and breaths were bated as the <i>Sk</i><i style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.7;">yp</i><i style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.7;">e</i><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.7;"> call was placed – a spontaneous round of applause broke out when contact was made and the voices from 11,000 kilometers away were heard.   The broadcast was underway!</span></p>
<p>Anchors from each school introduced their segments and the Master Controller, Heather, mixed the live feed, the Skype feed and the recorded video on the fly. Director Ryan maintained <i>Skype</i> contact with the <i>Uttam Times</i> artfully signing them on and off.  Producer, Kezia, whose hard work contributed to the evening’s successful broadcast provided Hindi translation services when necessary and problem-solved when the final recorded segment seemed lost in cyber-space.  Due to some quick thinking on the part of one of the anchors and a guest appearance by Ms. Cey enough time was bought to allow the inclusion of the elusive video.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2331" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 300px"><a href="../../files/2014/01/IMG_1226.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2331" src="../../files/2014/01/IMG_1226-300x224.jpg" alt="UCHS Journalism Class" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/01/IMG_1226-300x224.jpg 300w, https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/01/IMG_1226-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">UCHS Journalism Class</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another round of applause occurred when the newscast ended and the final sign off completed.  The one hour broadcast and the newscast team of eight; producer, master controller, teleprompter, the three UCHS and two Uttam anchors belies the hours of planning, researching, interviewing, writing and filming that was undertaken by the Journalism students at UCHS and the students at the Uttam School for Girls.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Ruth Cey, the purpose of the project was not only to <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.7;">provide an authentic, genuine journalism experience but also to connect, collaborate and ultimately encounter and experience cultural similarities and differences – and so they did from the rural Canadian world of pick-up trucks and hockey to the more poetic use of language and the world of billiards, golf and tennis of the Uttam School for Girls.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2333" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="../../files/2014/01/IMG_1221.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2333" src="../../files/2014/01/IMG_1221-300x224.jpg" alt="They made it happen!" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/01/IMG_1221-300x224.jpg 300w, https://learning.lskysd.ca/curriculumconnections/files/2014/01/IMG_1221-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">They made it happen!</figcaption></figure>
<p>The streaming video has been <a href="http://streaming.lskysd.ca/player/?i=71">archived</a>. Students are currently reviewing and editing some of the footage so there maybe a few changes once final exams are completed.  Contact Ruth Cey (@ruthcey) for information about how this inquiry-based journalism project came to be and contact Ryan Kobelsky at the <a href="http://www.lskysd.ca/CentralOffice/staff-directory/Pages/default.aspx">Living Sky School Division</a> for information about the technical aspects of the project.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">A resolution is not just the degree of sharpness of a computer-generated image as measured by the number of dots per linear inch or number of pixels on a display screen, but it is also the degree of sharpness, focus, concentration and effort one places on a personal goal.<span>  </span>Creating a resolution is a good starting point in helping to determine a direction for the new year.<span>  </span>It guides our thinking and renews our determination, in the hope that we will ‘stick with it’ to the bitter end, overcoming all that stands in our way.<span>  </span>The first step is creating a plan! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'"><span> </span><i>“A vision without a plan is just a dream.<span>  </span>A plan without a vision is just drudgery.<span>  </span>But a vision with a plan can change the world’” – Unknown</i></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">I hope this list helps motivate you and propel you forth into 2014 with renewed spirit, enthusiasm and love of life!<span>  </span>It is time to break the mold, go out on your own, try new things, not be afraid of failure . . . . learn from mistakes and never stop trying!</span></p>

<p>Christmas Musical Hits and 1,2,3 and a 4!</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Education?  There has not been a new Christmas themed pop hit for at least twenty years.  Compare that to the fundamental recent changes in Education.  When many of us began our careers twenty or so years ago what was the classroom like?  The issues were ever present; they just seem to have become more complex.  Technology and computers? DVD Players? Formative Assessment and testing? Poverty? Broken Families?  Data?  Merry Christmas? Many facets of education have changed but I worry about the pace, the research base, the exhaustion level of many of our colleagues.  What has changed for me are the stakeholder’s expectations. Change is difficult.  The response to all of the recent changes is understandable and yet we ask for more.  I don’t want to forget about the past, but as we approach these ideas with an open and professional mindset the future looks promising.  There are pieces of the new agenda that are helpful if we are willing to sing along!</p>
<p>Benefits of technology &#8211; Why is there a reluctance to share our personal knowledge of these amazing devices/software with our children.  I am hoping we can move from using this tool – to engaging learners who actually use these devices for innovations, inventions and thoughtful inquiry. Hopefully it can become just a natural progression of what we do. Let’s take some risks. Make something new!</p>
<p>Benefits of assessment – Can we learn without a percent? I think if children can see themselves in the curriculum or embedded in the assessment they will learn at a more successful rate.   Posing engaging, insightful questions that causes us all to deliberate will spawn deeper thinking and learning.  Memorization vs. Automaticity!  Try eliminating the scores and just provide some rubrics and write some “lyrics”.  This tends to improve achievement and provoke some greater motivation.</p>
<p>Benefits of data – Hoshin Kanri, Graduation rates and testing of our students.  When the question is answered people become more at ease – Data: How is it going to be used?  I think for our organization, it’s all about student learning.  I am confident that we are interested in providing services to those who really need it.  If we can meaningfully come together as an educational community and help students from FN/M backgrounds, immigrant students, enrichment and differentiation situations we will succeed.   We do have plan in reading, writing and math and it is about all students getting better/improving. These will be our Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>Circumstances change and as they become more complex, the way we react to them is all about our integrity and character.  Maybe we should open our minds to embrace some of these new evidence based decision making strategies.  The benefits outweigh the discomfort some of us are feeling.  For me as a superintendent, it’s not about questioning our staff’s professionalism it’s about counting on it! Potentially one of our students could digitally produce that “new” Christmas hit; a hit that we all can embrace.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">

					<p>As a teacher I used formative assessment on a daily basis before I knew it was called formative assessment.  I recorded some of the formative data I collected and reported it to parents on report cards.  I also included student behaviors in report card marks such as completed/incomplete work, attendance and participation.  Sometimes the feedback I provided my students was irrelevant and provided little, if any opportunity for growth.  I could beat myself up about it or I could learn from my experiences and apply new understandings to help improve student learning while also improving my teaching practice.</p>
<p>Often times the education system is criticized for not being relevant to the real world.  During my daughter’s basketball practice I started to see how formative assessment is related.  Players have an opportunity to practice specific skills while coaches provide feedback for improvement.   Eventually individual skills are combined to prepare for application in a game situation.  My daughter played her first game on Saturday.  I saw this as a summative experience because the players demonstrated the skills learned during practice.  The coaches could still provide feedback and make notes about what to work on at the next practice.</p>
<p>Then I started to think about swim club.   Again, my children attended practice to learn skills and set goals.  Coaches provided timely and specific feedback on various skills.  At the first swim meet the goal was for my child to make it to the end of the pool without touching the bottom.  After a race, the coach would know what to work on at the next practice to improve upon personal goals.  Eventually the goal was working towards standard times set for swimmers.  There were some meets which my husband was unable to attend but he still wanted to know how our children were doing.  When I let him know that our child beat a personal best or were three tenths of a second from an ‘A’ time or made an efficient flip turn, he was able to understand how she was swimming.  When I shared my opinion and told him that she looked so cute on the starting block with bug-eye goggles, huge smile and proud waves to the crowd, I didn’t really share how she was doing.  I can’t imagine how anyone could disagree with my opinion but it was irrelevant to how she swam her races.  Just as my husband wanted specific information according to the goal, parents of the students in our classes need information on how their children perform according to the outcome.  This shared information is summative.  My husband and I didn’t require daily practice updates – formative assessment – but if our children were not improving from one swim meet to the next, the coach might have had a discussion with us for an improvement plan that we could be aware of and support. However, the implementation and use of formative assessment was critical to the process.</p>
<p>Sports and school aren’t the only places where formative assessment is practiced.  A driver’s license is earned after a test but not before practice and feedback from driving instructors and parents (sometimes positive, sometimes not!).  After completing a written test, all drivers are subject to a road test.  Not all drivers pass the first road test.  The road test results are not averaged.  When a driver passes the road test, they earn a license regardless of how many road tests were required.</p>
<p>As teachers we also receive feedback from our students, colleagues and parents.  Some feedback is requested, some is positive and some is negative.  When I think about the positive feedback I received from parents, rarely was it specific.  “Thank you for being a good teacher.”  What does that really mean?  What do parents think I am good at?  When I received negative feedback from parents and colleagues it really stung and I tended to dwell on it but after much reflection I was able to learn from that feedback because often times the negative feedback was more specific.  Although our students may not have the finesse or skills to critically share specific feedback, non-verbal communication can also provide feedback from our students as to how we are meeting student needs.</p>
<p>Just as it is difficult to hear negative feedback, it is difficult to share feedback sometimes.  It may be difficult to find something a student has done well on an assignment just as it may be difficult to suggest something for improvement.  I know that I need to practice providing feedback to students and right now it feels and sounds somewhat robotic but with practice, I know that I will improve on providing specific, timely feedback to students.</p>
<p>Although formative assessment is not always formally recorded in real life, in real life we practice, we perform, and we learn from our mistakes.  Mistakes can be realized internally and mistakes can be shared through feedback.  Teaching is a practice and I know that I require practice to help students achieve their learning goals.  I also know that what I do and understand today will change but that today I am doing the best I can with what I know and understand.</p>

					<p>by Michelle Sanderson</p>
<p>Cross-posted at <a href="../../../indigenouseducation/index.html">Indigenous Education</a></p>
<p>I recently read,  an article about Paul Martin as printed in May 15, 2013, in  the Globe &amp; Mail (Toronto, Canada), Aboriginal education vexes Martin, Canada.,  and I invite you all to take a good critical read of this article. To summarize, Martin is celebrated for putting some of his own money into projects aimed at helping Indigenous people.   I bring indigenous history and an anti-racist, anti-colonial, and critical lens to the article in understanding the reasons and manner with which Mr. Martin  concentrates his efforts to alleviate the suffering and attempting to address the problems experienced by Aboriginal people.</p>
<p>After reading the article, I found that Martin names a lot of the problems indigenous people face when being a member of an oppressed group in Canada. These are touted on two different areas in the article, some of the problems that he named quite uncritically, I might add, are half of the homes have single parent families, half of the students who are in school are in foster care, high unemployment rates, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, weak literacy/low literacy rates, lack of role models, reserves are economic dead ends,  poor housing, educational inequalities,  25% – 40% less funding per student for primary students in schools, and last but not least, gangs, crime and violence.</p>
<p>That list is a little overwhelming, maybe even daunting. However;  the problem with the article, is that the reader is left to their own devices to make sense of these sad and grim statistics.  Without a critical view of what all of this means, the article in itself, serves to do a dis-service to indigenous people.  I commend Martin on putting his money where his mouth is, but, at the same time, I worry, that without a critical understanding of the statistics he’s touted, that he just may be very well be perpetrating stereotypes about the very people he’s trying to help. We must ever be conscious of the brush of stereotyping.</p>
<p>As many elders and spiritual elders explain, you can’t solve a problem with the same mindset that created it.  If you know your Canadian history, then you’ll be aware of how our early indigenous ancestors experienced the newcomers. The newcomers saw our early indigenous ancestors as needing help, that there was something wrong with them, that they didn’t have something, that should be given to them, that they, the oppressors could provide. This deficit thinking led to some very profound mindsets, or strategies, which painted indigenous people with negative connotations.  Without a critical understanding of these multi-faceted problems called into attention, we may blame the victim.  We can avoid that by  educating ourselves and understanding our nation’s true history, which isn’t pretty.</p>
<p>It is this very Canadian history, which is intertwined with colonialism, racism,  which in large, lead to where First Nations people are today.  Policies like residential schools to “take the Indian out of the child” were a real part of our history and it’s this, our shared history, which has material consequences in today’s society. Unrealized treaty promises lead to economic detriment to First Nations farmers. There were untold opportunity, for the early settlers, and true, like the Canadian national story tells, there were difficult times for those settlers. However; those settlers had opportunity and privilege which was systematically denied to the early First Nations farmers. Time and time again tales of withheld impliments, denied access to the market are told about our First Nations farmers. It’s sad to hear about it, but as well, there are many tales of lost lands, which were then placed into the hands of the newcomers or settlers. These are the stories that are untold in public education, deliberatly or not, which need to be told.  It is these events, which have  lead to the material consequences of poverty for generations for some and wealth for others. Some are still benefitting off the wealth of that very land today. So, although it may seem like it’s all in the past, there are true material consequences to the policies and laws that were put into place in the early 1900′s to privilege some and to deny others. This, in short,  is the definition of racism. In order to move forward, we need to acknowledge our dark past. There’s no moving forward without the validation of the truth.  There are still tons of residual trauma connected with unrealized treaty promises, residential schools and policies like the Indian Act. The last residential school, here in Saskatchewan, was closed only in the 90′s. It’s not far enough in our distant past to relay the racism as a past tense, as in it happens no more. These same policies are at the root of today’s lived oppression, poverty and intergenerational trauma which have affected today’s indigenous people. Many of us both indigenous and settler, are trying very hard to walk a new path, and reconnect with wellness, through a variety of ways, and it’s important if we’re going to walk this road in the manner our indigenous ancestors intended, hand in hand, sharing all economic opportunities and the land and seeing each other as humans beings, as cousins, that we indigenous and settlers have to understand our dark past to meet our bright future together.</p>
<p>Regardless of thestatistics, or the problems which are said to be “plaguing” First Nations,  without fully understanding the situation, it is extremely detrimental to the communities you are working in to not understand our collective histories.  More importantly, when working with oppressed groups, such as Canada’s First Nations, it’s important to remember that the indigenous people did not arrive at such atrocities by themselves.  These problems and statistics are real material consequences which were, and are, arrived at through policies, procedures and implementations of real laws aimed at marginalizing the First Nations people.</p>
<p>Some of the laws aren’t too far in the distant past. In this modern day and age, we can see differences in funding, as much as 13,000.00 per child, in on- reserve schools, compared to provincial schools.  This only serves to ensure a lower quality of education, ensure less teacher time for indigenous students on reserve than in the city. Martin is right when he talks about our indigenous students being second class.  And the policies just keep coming! With the education act being pushed through parliament with the omnibus bills, we see more legislation coming to provide even less to indigenous students on-reserve.</p>
<p>One challenge I would put to Martin, is to look at First Nations in a new way, as a group of oppressed people who <em>do</em> have the role models in their communities, who <em>do</em> care about their children’s education and well being,  and indeed many First Nations people do work, are sober, are educated,  pay taxes and deserve to be treated and talked about with dignity when and where the subject of indigenous people exists, in education, in mainstream, in the economy and even in the media. It is also equally important to realize that for those who are suffering ongoing lived oppression, that they didn’t quite get there by themselves and that Canada itself has a long and on-going violent colonial  history toward Aboriginal people and would do well to acknowledge its role in the predicament that First Nations and Metis students find themselves in.</p>
<p>I’ve included some links and citations to some articles, which delve into these multi-faceted issues further.  I hope my article/blog sparks some conversations, to change the old way of seeing and look through the world with new critically awakened eyesight. I applaud Mr. Martin and I hope that he continues work for the wellness of all humankind and I encourage him to further educate himself as to how to better “become an ally.”</p>
